# Website

My personal blog and website.

This is my personal digital garden where I want to post and write stuff for myself and for you.

## Philosophy

I want to create a simple website for myself from scratch using modern technology but with some simple philosophy in mind:

- Need to be created from scratch without super complex and pre-built frameworks (using only js, html, css small framework)
- Easy to create, update and maintain
- Fast
- Focus on content (and with a value)
- Everything in english (maybe later I'll translate to Italian also)

The purpose of this website is also to learn Javascript, web and frontend technologies with best practices.

If you see something that it's not right or correct, or if you think I can do something better, please let me know opening an issue :)

## Created with

- [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/) The web framework for content-driven websites
- [Chota css](https://jenil.github.io/chota/#!) a small micro css framework
